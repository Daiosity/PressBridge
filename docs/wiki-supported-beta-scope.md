# Supported Beta Scope

Lenviqa core is currently beta-safe where the repo has repeatable validation coverage.

That validated core currently includes:

- route resolution for:
  - home route
  - standard page routes
  - nested hierarchical page routes
  - standard post routes
  - unresolved-route honesty
  - basic path normalization
- Gutenberg-aware rendering for common layout patterns:
  - nested groups
  - columns inside groups
  - media-text recovery from saved markup
  - cover sections with inner content
  - gallery fallback from saved markup
  - button-group layout intent
- preview foundations:
  - valid preview token resolution
  - honest invalid/expired preview failure
  - preview content staying separate from normal public routing
- package/install/runtime confidence:
  - repeatable ZIP packaging
  - package structure validation
  - activation defaults
  - starter export hook presence
  - deactivation/uninstall checks

This is not a promise of universal WordPress frontend parity.
