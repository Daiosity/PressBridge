Connect WordPress to modern frontends.

== Description ==

PressBridge turns a normal WordPress site into a headless-ready backend without breaking the editing experience.

This MVP plugin focuses on a practical bridge:

* Keep WordPress admin, pages, posts, menus, and public post types
* Expose a cleaner REST namespace for frontend consumption
* Configure a React frontend URL from wp-admin
* Hand off public traffic safely while protecting editors and admins
* Generate signed preview links for React frontends
* Export a starter React app with route resolution and preview support

The plugin is designed to be maintainable now and extensible later for premium features such as ACF, WooCommerce, auth bridging, deployment helpers, and SSR presets.

This is an alpha-stage bridge plugin. It is intentionally conservative:

* WordPress remains the editorial system
* wp-admin and editor workflows remain protected
* frontend takeover is configurable rather than forced
* the React starter is a starting point, not a WordPress theme replacement

== Features ==

* Headless mode toggle with safe fallback behavior
* Frontend app URL validation for local and deployed React apps
* Route handling mode for either safe WordPress rendering or public redirect handoff
* Custom REST endpoints for site config, menus, pages, posts, content types, single content, previews, and route resolution
* Normalized content mapping for React-friendly payloads
* Signed preview token support for cross-domain frontend previews
* Gutenberg editor guidance for preview and React route access
* "View in React" shortcuts in editor and frontend admin surfaces
* Exportable Vite + React starter app

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin ZIP through `Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin`, or copy the `pressbridge` folder into `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate `PressBridge`.
3. Go to `Settings > PressBridge`.
4. Add your frontend app URL, for example `http://localhost:5173`.
5. Leave route handling in WordPress mode while integrating.
6. Switch to redirect mode once your React frontend is ready to own public routes.

== Development Notes ==

The main local development assumptions in this repo are:

* WordPress runs through Local
* the example local site URL is `http://pressbridge.local`
* the React frontend commonly runs on `http://localhost:5173`
* the plugin REST namespace is `pressbridge/v1`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this break wp-admin? =

No. The plugin is intentionally conservative. It does not redirect `wp-admin`, login, REST, AJAX, cron, or logged-in editors who still need WordPress routes.

= Does this require GraphQL? =

No. The MVP uses the native WordPress REST API and a custom namespace optimized for React-friendly responses.

= Can I use this with custom post types? =

Yes. Public post types are exposed through the generic `items` and `content` routes, and archive-style route resolution is supported.

= Does preview work on a separate frontend domain? =

Yes. Preview links use signed temporary tokens so a React frontend can request preview content directly from WordPress.

= Is the React starter meant to match my active WordPress theme exactly? =

No. PressBridge translates WordPress-managed content and block structure into a React frontend. It aims for coherent layout translation, not pixel-perfect theme cloning.

= Does this support WooCommerce or ACF yet? =

Not in the MVP. The architecture is built so those can be added later without rewriting the bridge.
